## Individualistic countries;

Importance of personal expression and assertion

 e.g.  United Kindom

## Collectivistic countries

Importance of group harmony maintenance
 
 e.g. Chile
 
(@heinrichs_cultural_2006, @hofmann_cultural_2010) 

## Introduction

Studies have shown that although collectivistic countries experience higher levels of social anxiety, its not obvious due to their belonging to a group. (@schreier_social_2010)
 

Thus, we hypothesised that reports for social anxiety will appear to be more in individualistic countries despite the higher levels in collectivistic.

## Hypothesis

 Google searches related to social anxiety, appear to be more in individualistic cultures than in collectivistics.
 
I.V. Type of society: Chile (collectivistic)  and United Kingdom (individualistic) 

D.V. google "hits" on terms related to social anxiety

## Methods

Downloaded data from google trends for social phobia (UK) and fobia social (CL)

Analyzed data

T-test analysis
To compare the means of each countries' hits

## Data

![alt text](Rplot01.png)

Google "hits" for Chile (CL) and UK (GB)

 Chille "Fobia Social"
 UK "Social Phobia"
 



## Results
sample estimates:
mean of CL mean of GB

 42.53846   7.50000
 
t(53.471) = 12.068, p < 2.2e-16

The results showed that there is a statistically significant difference, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and we accept the alternative.

Therefore, we know that there is significant difference between the means, but  more hits appeared in Chile rathen than in UK

## Discussion

Our results opposed to our hypothesis.
Specifically,

they confirmed that collectivistic countries experience higher levels of social anxiety, since their actions are being constantly evaluated by the members of the group (@heinrichs_cultural_2006)


BUT they didn't confirm the fact that it's not apparent due to their belonging to  group. (@schreier_social_2010)

## Limitations/Future implications 

1) Google Trends Analysis is less valid as a method on its own. A qualitative research would be needed as well

2) In the project we used one-level experimental groups: One Latin- American country for Collectivistic and one European for Individualistic.

3) We used one term related to social anxiety for each country (Fobia Social, Social Phobia). More terms could possibly increase the validity and reliability of the results (eg: Social Anxiety)
